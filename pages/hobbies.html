        <h2>Current Hobbies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Music</strong> - I enjoy exploring new music and adding albums to my digital collection. I think past I would attend gigs on a weekly basis but I'm far too old for that now.</li> <br>
                <li><strong>Goshuin</strong> - This is a hobby in which you visit Japanese shrines and temples to collect stamps. The stamps are put into a book and are dated. You can travel Japan and collect these stamps as you go.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Gym</strong> - With my current job I have to remain in shape and practice workout routines for my clients. It's not something I do religously but I try.</li>

            <h2>Hobbies I Want To Start</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Youtube</strong> - For a long time I've wanted to start a YouTube channel. I would love to start one centered around my progression with learning to code</li> <br>
                <li><strong>Photography</strong> - I've always been amazed with people who can effortlessly take beautiful photos. There seems to be so much to learn about Photography but I'm willing to learn.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Running</strong> - After just finishing reading Can't Hurt Me by David Goggins, I feel inspired to take up long distance running. I aim to run the Osaka marathon in November</li>
